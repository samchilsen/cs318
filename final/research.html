    <h2 class="title">The Impact of the Manitowoc Shipyard During World War II: The Relationship Between National Pride and Production During
        World War II</h2>
    <p class="date">January 2018 - Present</p>
    <p>This paper addresses the societal impact of small town America during the Second World War, specifically of Manitowoc,
        Wisconsin during World War II. Socially the city of Manitowoc was impacted by the abrupt increase in population from
        1941-1945. In September of 1940 Manitowoc Shipbuilding Co. was given a contract to construct 10 Submarines for the
        war effort. The number of workers who poured into the shipyard to work was substantial. During World War II The Manitowoc
        Shipbuilding Co. employed 7,000 people working around the clock for the war years. Those employed at the shipyard
        included men, a large number amount of women and youth workers, either still being educated in local high schools
        or recently graduated. Manitowoc grew substantially as workers and crewmembers were being bused in from neighboring
        communities and contributing to the growth of the local economy. Manitowoc became a boomtown during the war, the
        vibrant lifestyle which took place between the parties, and dances and the local establishments which transformed
        Manitowoc into what was common of war-time cities. A community which came together for the good of the country rather
        than self-recognition and this idea of working for the country and working for “Uncle Sam” was a prime morale boost
        for those who worked in the Shipyard and lived in Manitowoc, Wisconsin.</p>

    <h2 class="title">The 17th Amendment Did Not Hinder Party Machines But Caused a Federal Crisis</h2>
    <p class="date">January 2018 - Present</p>
    <p>
        The Progressive Era in the United States was a time profound reform, with one of the main objectives of progressive politicians
        being to eliminate government corruption. The progressive ideas, as well as populist ideas of having the people have
        more input rather than party dominance and big money politics, was at the center of the progressive drive. Rather
        than the norm of what government can do for society. This emerging philosophy instead centered on the question of,
        what can society do for government and how can the people, rather than political machines, or money? Implementation
        of this change, which would help society collectively, a constitutional change would be necessary. On April 8th,
        1913, the Seventeenth Amendment was ratified, Connecticut was the last state needed to secure the three-quarters
        needed to pass the amendment. The amendment’s main purpose was to curtail the power of the party bosses who have
        been building up influence and securing power in state legislatures which prior to the amendment chose the senators.
        Although the amendment was used as a tool to promote democracy, senatorial candidates had to campaign like never
        before, because of the amendment’s main goal of limiting agendas - which were set by party bosses - and regulating
        the nomination process.
