    <p class="desc">
        My name is Logan Rooney and I am an energetic, personable, and loyal political enthusiast. I am currently a senior at the
        University of Wisconsin â€“ Eau Claire and will graduate in May 2018. My current role as a Campaign Manager for a Wisconsin
        State Assembly candidate has prepared to continue campaign work after graduation. My passion for social responsibility
        and community collaboration has led me into the public service realm and will continue to fuel my career development.
        I plan to pursue a career as a public servant in state or local government and eventually make the jump to the federal
        level as a public servant or lobbyist.
